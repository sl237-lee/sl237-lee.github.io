# Seungryul Lee — Personal Site

This is a simple, single-file site designed for GitHub Pages. It pulls content from your resume and is easy to maintain.

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository named **sl237-lee.github.io**.
2. Download `sl237-lee-site.zip` from our chat and extract it.
3. Copy all files into your repo (keep the `assets/resume.pdf` path).
4. Commit and push to the **main** branch.
5. Visit: https://sl237-lee.github.io

### Custom domain (optional)
- Add a `CNAME` file in the repo root containing your domain (e.g. `seungryul.dev`).
- Point DNS to GitHub Pages and enable HTTPS in **Settings → Pages**.

## Update your content
- Edit `index.html` directly (About, Skills, Experience, Projects).
- Replace `assets/resume.pdf` if you update your Overleaf export.

**Tips**
- Keep projects short with links to GitHub repos or demos.
- Add a social image (Open Graph) later if you want richer link previews.
